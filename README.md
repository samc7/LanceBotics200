This was the Official LanceBotics 200 Robotics team website at the end of the 2020 VEX Robotics Season, which ended abruptly due to the
COVID-19 Pandemic. From 2017 to 2020, I was the lead website developer for the team, adding and uploading our content for our members, 
parents, other teams, sponsors, as well as for the 
[VEX Online Challenge Entry](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/106/entry/6961) for the website, in which I was a [finalist](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/106/entry?filter=finalists).

## The Unusual Design

Since it was my final season as well as my final year of high school, my plan for the was to make a website that looked like no other. 
I thought to myself, "What if I used 100% of my brain?" Which, although a meme, it made me realize that many websites didn't use a lot 
of the space on screens for content, and there was extra space everywhere. So I thought to myself again, "What if I used 100% of the 
website space?"

While designing the website, I was told by some that it was "abnormal" and that I should've stuck to a simpler, classic and cliche 
design. But as new screens on phones push to the edge of their housing, and new TVs have almost no bezels, it's only normal for us 
to adjust our website content to fit this new push towards using all the space we have available.

I hope you enjoy reading about my team as much as I enjoyed developing this website and participating on this wonderful team!
